Your system should already have PostgreSQL server installed and running.

DBDish uses the standard PG* environment variables to determine the
connection arguments, the tests by default use a 'dbdishtest' database,
that you can create with:

    psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE dbdishtest;' -U postgres

If you want to use a different database or other connection parameters,
set the corresponding environment variable, for example:

    export PGDATABASE = 'public';

This will connect to the 'public' on 'localhost' at port 5432.

The user should have connect and create table priv's on the database.
